				<h1 class="title">The Game Masters</h1>
				<br>
				<h3 class="center"> Now, you may be wondering, &ldquo;Just how did Elements come to be&#63;&rdquo; Well, here's each of our stories of how we 
				ended up meeting each other and creating this masterpiece of a game. </h3>
				<div class="game_master_box">
					<h1 class="game_master_name">Snowi</h1>
					<p class="game_master_story">My name is Elijah M. Wadley, also known as Snowi. I am the creator of Elements and the world it takes place in. Since I was a kid, this was the world my mind has created. My ADHD and over-active imagination allowed me to create a world full of creatures, elementals, and stories for everyone living there. With the help and volunteer work of my Team, we are able to bring this universe to life in the style of an Open World RPG game! I am working on every aspect of this game with each team, and making sure we can make this game into something incredible. I met these people through discord servers and communities across the globe. This project has been a dream of mine since I was a kid. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I enjoy the world. Snowi's Words Of Advice: "Explore. EVERYTHING. There are many places, Easter eggs, and inside jokes to find that may make your experience just that much more exciting." </p>

					<h1 class="game_master_name">Nessu</h1>
					<p class="game_master_story">Hello there, I'm Ryen J. Kao, who you'll know as Nessu. By pure chance, I just so happen to be online during a time long ago when Snowi would randomly announce in an old server of his, saying something along the lines of: “AYO SERVER, IM MAKING A GAME! COME OVER IF YOU'RE INTERESTED”, and so I did, and have been hanging out ever since. As the lead writer of the stories you see within this project, I pray they are enjoyable to read through. Many of what shall be written stems from original characters of mine, certain members characters in the server, and of the game masters themselves. As well as hopefully, some evenly paced, but strong world building of Sosaku, (my writing is also pretty damn amateur, so judge it all you want). Jayden is my best pal, you'll see me hanging around with him more often than not. Of course, my main goal, is to blow up, and then act like I don't know nobody!</p>

					<h1 class="game_master_name">Twisted</h1>
					<p class="game_master_story">Hello I am known as Twisted (Sometimes T-Jayy). I joined to be first support my good friend Snowi and also to have some good fun for myself to express my creativity through story telling and also game mechanics. I am a MLBB player that has just gotten tournaments that gets streamed to 2k people and working on being qualified for the official NASL Tournament. I'm chess player and I always think 1 step ahead, I love being aggressive but I know my limits, I'm also specially good when it comes to 1v1s.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game_master_box">
					<h1 class="game_master_name">Jayden</h1>
					<p class="game_master_story">Yo, I'm David Delgado, y'all can call me Jayden though. So, one of my friends prompted me to get discord, and so I did. I joined a few servers from youtubers I watched and I was kinda at that point where you just accept literally every server invite you get. And I'm so glad that Cuddlegang RPG was one of them. If it wasn't, I wouldn't have met Ness and the homies, and I probably wouldn't even be on the path to learn to code. If you wanna git gud, just do what I did and farm, not that there was much else to do. Also, f•ck Ness, all my homies love Ness.</p>

				<div class="game_master_box">
					<h1 class="game_master_name">Rokkr</h1>
					<p class="game_master_story">Names IllusionEnd, but in here I'm known as Rokkr, I'm just a gamer and enjoys traveling from game to game. I joined this server out of curiosity. Met new friends and players that are passionate about this games future. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do. I'm the jack of all trades, the dumbest luck, and hide your ale, or else I'm stealing it from your inventory.</p>

				<div class="game_master_box">
					<h1 class="game_master_name">Alpha</h1>
					<p class="game_master_story">Sup guys, I'm AlphaChillua (commonly called Alpha). I was one of the past players and testers from the old elements game—all the way back in 2020! I really enjoy strategy games, Fighting games, tower defense games (mainly BTD), and rpgs. I play a few games competitively, such as SSBU (smash ultimate), Rocket league (mobile), and BTD battles 1&2. My goals are to make an eSports ORG, become a good graphic designer, and to make lots of connections and friends. Always remember that having fun comes first with games! And .watercat (iykyk)</p>

				<div class="game_master_box">
					<h1 class="game_master_name">Kira</h1>
					<p class="game_master_story">Ciara Kim, otherwise known as the “Cookie Master” or just Kira. Though absent nowadays, she will stop by on the occasion if she were to be needed. She was brought over in the middle of the night near the start of the server due to just how small the project was at the time, and luckily she stuck around. Though no clear objective, she came over to play test, and more or less help with gameplay ideas. A little something about her is she is a musician, who chose the Piano as her instrument. - Nessu</p>

					<h1 class="game_master_name">Eirika</h1>
					<p class="game_master_story">HEY! HEY! HEY! I'm Eeveelicous, but everyone actually just calls me by Eirika. How I found this amazing place is by randomly finding it on disboard I think? IT WAS COMPLETELY RANDOM I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GETTING INTO. I've really fallen off games lately, and really am only here to watch the progression and hang out… I'll be the best, and worst morale support you'll ever see! I wish to be a fashion design artist in due time, so if I'm still around, maybe I could pitch in someway through that. Enjoy, and have fun with the time you spend here. Mayhaps you can even find your Best Rival here! :o</p>

				<div class="game_master_box">
					<h1 class="game_master_name">Starnova</h1>
					<p class="game_master_story">Greetings I'm HCstarnova or Star which most peeps call me and I'm the weirdo who does art, gaming with a bit of  graphic arts ( not quite a pro with graphics yet). I was yeeted into this server to try and do the thing, help with the game. Yep I'm new to stuff like this, so it'll take some time for me to figure things out, not space out a bunch. But for now I'll try my best to assist and help out with this game to the best of my abilities.</p>
