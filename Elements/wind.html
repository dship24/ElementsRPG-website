			<p> This Element is a Support type. Wind users can apply 2 kinds of buffs to themselves, though only  1 at a time.
				They can either give an ally or themself +2 attack the next time they roll, or they can apply a damage reduction
				buff to themself, which reduces the damage taken by 4 the next time they're hit. </p>

				<table>
					
					<tr>

						<td>  Wild Winds: At the start of the tree, the damage buff that you can get increases to 3, but once 
							you finish unlocking the skill trees, you'll be able to choose 1 ally's die and give them +2 on 
							their next roll,
							<span class="Italic">
							and
							</span>
							decrease the roll of 
							<span class="Italic">
							all
							</span>
							enemies by 2.
						</td>
						
				
						<td> Ward Winds: At the very beginning of the tree, the damage reduction buff will jump from 4 to 6. 
							By the time you reach the end of the tree, your defense buff will give the targeted player 
							the option to hover, which allows them to not take any damage from close ranged weapons for the 
							the next turn. The defense buff will go 
							up to 12 damage that can be tanked.
						</td>
			
						<td> Wandering Winds: At the start of the tree, you'll lose the ability to buff, but you'll gain some 
						passive AOE damage. Every 3 turns, your attack will do 25% of your damage to enemies that are adjacent
						to your targeted enemy. At the end of the tree, you'll have a 10% chance to have a 2nd attack that 
						deals 50% of the damage of the previous attack, and every single time you attack, you'll be dealing 25% 
						of your damage to enemies that were adjacent to that targeted enemy.
