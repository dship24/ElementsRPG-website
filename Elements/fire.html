			<h1 class="fire"> The Scorching Element, Fire </h1>

			<br>
			
			<p class="F-overview"> This Element is best suited to dealing damage, as it's boost will deal damage per turn based on how many stacks it has. A 3rd degree burn will deal 2 damage per turn, a 2nd degree will deal 1
				damage per turn along with a 5% chance for the enemy to skip their turn, and a 1st degree burn will do 3 damage per turn with a 10% chance for the enemy to skip their turn. </p>

				<h2 class="Fire"> The Subclasses </h2>
				
				<br>
			
				<table>
					
					<tr>

						<td> Blue Burns: It starts with a 5% chance for the enemy to skip their turn that stacks with both a 2nd and 1st degree burn, and when the tree is fully unlocked, enemies who're burned will have 2
							subtracted from their rolls, so their rolls will be much lower than they were before. 
						</td>
						
				
						<td> Bigger Blaze: At the starting point, a 2nd degree burn will be doing 2 damage per turn instead of 1 along with the chance to skip the enemy's turn, but the later you get in the tree, you can get 
							a 25% chance to double the burn damage you do per turn, and your burn damage will do 5 damage per turn no matter how many times it's stacked. 
						</td>
			
						<td> Burning Bombs: At the beginning, your 2nd degree burn will be doing 2 damage instead of 1, but immediately after that in the tree, you'll trade the chance to skip turn with a 25% chance to 
							apply burn to enemies that are adjacent to the one that you're targeting. That 25% chance will become a 50% at max level.
