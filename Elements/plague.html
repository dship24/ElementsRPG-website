			<br>
			
			<p> This Element is a control type. Infected enemies will be affected in 2 ways. Every odd turn, they'll take 2 damage,
				and every even turn, they'll deal 2 less damage. </p>

				<table>
					
					<tr>

						<td> 
						Slick Striker: It starts off with your infect damage being increased to 3, but at it's final level,
						there will be a 25% chance that infect points will spread to other enemies, and your infect damage
						 will be doing 4 damage per turn.
						</td>
						
				
						<td>
						Sick Surgeon: At starting level, it'll increase the attack debuff to enemies by 1, but when it's 
						maxed out, your enemy won't be able to remove infect until it's fully stacked, 
						<span class="Italic"> and </span>
						you'll gain attack for the amount of attack debuffs that are on your enemies.
						</td>
			
						<td>  
						Slaughter Skin: As soon as you get it, you'll have a 25% chance to apply an infect point to the enemy 
						that attacks you, and when this branch is completed, when you're attacked, your enemy will get a 
						guaranteed infect point on them and enemies who are infected have a 25% chance to skip their turn.
