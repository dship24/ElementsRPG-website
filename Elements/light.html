			<br>
			
			<p> This Element is a mixture between a support and a control type. Their Elemental Boost is Blind. They can apply this to an enemy for that enemy to have a 10% chance to 
			attack a different target then they were originally going to. That includes both their party members, and yours. </p>

			<h2 class="Light"> The Subclasses </h2>

			<table>
			
				<tr>
				
					<td> <span class="Bold"> Divine Acolytes: </span> Your Elemental Boost will be replaced with a buff that grants a 10% damage boost and "Divinity"  to an ally, which 
					grants a 15% damage bonus against Unholy enemies. At max level, all of your allies will be doing twice the damage to unholy enemies. </td>
					
					<td> <span class="Bold"> Shining Supremacy: </span> Your Elemental Boost is replaced with a buff that grants an ally a chance to not take a point of an enemy's 
					Elemental Boost. At max level, you can apply it to your entire team at a 50% chance, or apply it to 1 ally for guaranteed immunity, 2 times. </td>
					
					<td> <span class="Bold"> Church of Light: </span> If you choose this subclass, you'll have the choice to blind an enemy, or purify an ally, which removes any 
					Elemental debuff. At max level, you'll be able to completely remove any Elemental Boost points on an ally and the chance for enemies affected by Blind to
					attack one of their allies is raised to 40%. </td>
